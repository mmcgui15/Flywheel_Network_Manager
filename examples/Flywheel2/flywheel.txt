manage network of flywheels
monitor and track electrical I/O
interface with electric grids
*track efficiency of the flywheels


Notes/Questions

external power input (current&voltage)
    how does the flywheel speed up
power output due to load (current&voltage)
    how does the flywheel output power


Where are the flywheels located? Are they hooked up to a single powerplant?

Does the motor act as the generator or is there an input motor and a constant generator that allows for voltage smoothing?

Is power input/draw distributed evenly amongst flywheels in the system?

Variable inertia flywheels.

Is power loss due to precession a concern?
    How much power is lost and what is the torque on the (magnetic) bearing. 
    Program wheel orientation in relation to earth's axis?

Have a dedicated computer with this program at every flywheel site or at a
central hub with flywheel network access to sensors across multiple sites? Both?
    -Single vs multiple networks per .fly file.
    -Multiple networks open simultaneously?


TO DO
file stream to save settings .fly
    -2 files:
        1:list of recent files, gui window locations, open up most recent. only 1 instance of this file!
        2:individual flywheel networks, can have multiple files.

add units of measurement, check mathematical calculations

commit files

incorporate sensor
    arduino serial library or direct sensor without microcontroller.
        program usb serial data transfer?

flywheel efficiency(ideal power I/O based on velocity reading vs I/O sensor power readings)

error logging system
    critical errors and failsafes
    error tolerances

image rendering
    helix logo
    flywheel buttons
        -draggable organization
